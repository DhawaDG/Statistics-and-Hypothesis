### Statistics & Hypothesis Testing

This section of my portfolio is a deep dive into the world of statistics and hypothesis testing. It showcases my ability to apply a wide range of statistical methods to analyze data, validate assumptions, and draw meaningful, data-driven conclusions. From exploring data distributions to implementing hypothesis tests, these projects demonstrate a rigorous approach to quantitative analysis.

#### Topics Covered

- **Exploring Binary and Categorical Data:** Techniques for summarizing and visualizing categorical variables.
- **Correlation:** Measuring relationships between variables using correlation coefficients.
- **Exploring Two or More Variables:** Multivariate analysis to understand interactions and dependencies.
- **Data and Sampling Distributions:** Understanding how sample data relates to population distributions.
- **Sampling Distribution of a Statistic:** Examining the variability of sample statistics.
- **The Bootstrap:** Resampling methods to estimate the accuracy of sample statistics.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Calculating intervals to estimate population parameters.
- **Normal Distribution:** Properties and applications in statistical inference.
- **Long-Tailed Distributions:** Identifying and handling distributions with heavy tails.
- **Studentâ€™s t-Distribution:** Applying t-distribution for small sample sizes.
- **Binomial Distribution:** Modeling binary outcomes and proportions.
- **Poisson and Related Distributions:** Analyzing count data and rare events.
- **Techniques:** Implementing z test, t test, p value calculations, and KS test for hypothesis testing.
